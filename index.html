        <p>this is my first ever personal website. Have fun seeing how it changes as I learn more and more about how to create a personal website and make it look nice etc.</p>
        <p>i enjoy the simplicity and calmness of lowercase letters. but sometimes it seems off, and i think "maybe i should just switch to normal" and then i do the same thing again, so i guess sometimes i'm also a bit undecisive.</p>
        <p>i will add some interesting stuff on here as time goes. this, right now, is the start :)</p>
